# Healthcare Market Analysis & Sales Strategy Recommendations

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare claims data (2016–2018) to uncover actionable insights for improving the adoption of anesthesia drug products, specifically **Product 2**, in a competitive market. The analysis focuses on HCP behavior, patient demographics, and CVM claim trends to recommend optimized sales and marketing strategies.

## Key Objectives
1. **HCP Behavior Analysis:** Evaluate claim volumes to segment HCPs and recommend targeted sales force deployment.
2. **Patient Demographics:** Analyze patient age groups and claim trends to inform marketing budget allocation.
3. **CVM Trends:** Study CVM claims as a percentage of total claims and derive insights for competitive positioning.

## Analysis Highlights
- **HCP Insights:** 
  - Identified 85% of HCPs with fewer than 10 claims annually, guiding non-personal promotions (NPP) like emails and digital campaigns.
  - Prioritized high-volume HCPs (>10 claims/year) for in-person sales efforts.
- **Patient Demographics:**
  - Observed a 37% growth in claims for the 70–79 age group, suggesting targeted geriatric-focused campaigns.
  - Allocated budgets to address rising claims in the 80+ age group.
- **CVM Trends:**
  - CVM claims consistently comprised ~15% of total claims, indicating steady demand and opportunities to expand market share.

## Recommendations
1. **Sales Force Optimization:** Reallocate efforts to high-claim-volume HCPs while using NPP for low-volume HCPs.
2. **Marketing Strategy:** Increase focus on geriatric demographics (60+) with tailored messaging and digital outreach.
3. **Business Expansion:** Develop data-driven strategies to counter competitor growth and enhance Product 2 adoption.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python, R
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Tableau (for visualization)

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- `visualizations/`: Contains output charts and graphs.
- `presentation/`: Final project presentation slides.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/healthcare-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open `main_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed. Use `requirements.txt` for installation:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Future Work
- Perform **geographical analysis** to identify regional trends in claims and HCP behavior.
- Investigate competitor pricing and promotion strategies to refine competitive positioning.
- Expand patient demographics analysis to include comorbidities and chronic conditions.
